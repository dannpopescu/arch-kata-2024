# ADR-000: Using ADR

## Date:
2024-09-25

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We need to have a clear traceability of the important architectural decisions for long-term maintainability of our project.

## Decision:
We will use Architecture Decision Records, described by Michael Nygard.

## Consequences:
We chose to use ADRs to ensure clear, documented reasoning behind key architectural decisions, fostering alignment, transparency, and long-term maintainability in our project.

### PROS:
- **Enhanced traceability:** Decisions are easily tracked, providing context for future team members and stakeholders.
- **Improved collaboration:** ADRs encourage team discussion and consensus on architectural choices.
- **Informed future decisions:** ADRs serve as a knowledge base, preventing the repetition of past mistakes or overlooked alternatives.
- **Long-term maintainability:** Clear documentation aids in understanding the rationale behind decisions, especially when modifying or evolving the system.

### Cons:
- **Increased overhead:** Maintaining ADRs requires time and effort, which can be challenging if not integrated into regular processes.
- **Potential rigidity:** Documented decisions may lead to reluctance in changing approaches, even when needed.
